    "\n",
    "### Individual Tasks:\n",
    " \n",
    "**Jon:**\n",
    "- [x] Complete pipeline and make Python package.  Pipeline code should be [pip installable](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clarityviz/0.0.1).\n",
    "- [x] Provide evidence that the pipeline works.  Testing [here](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/Jupyter/ClarityVizPipelineResultsAccuracy.ipynb).\n",
    "- [x] Complete [documentation](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/Jupyter/ClarityViz%20Tutorial.ipynb) and organize Github repository \n",
    "\n",
    "**Luke:**\n",
    "- [x] Create [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lkzhu1/ubuntu/) for pipeline with Albert once pipeline is complete \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tony:**\n",
    "- [x] Addressed Davi Bock's issue - make a plotly plot of Cocaine174 where voxels are colored according to component size.\n",
    "    - [Jupyter Notebook containing a generalized Plotly plotting script for density](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/october5stuff/ChangingPlotlyColorByDensity.html).\n",
    "    - Deliverable was to apply it to Cocaine174 using ball size of 25, to color the voxels according to component size.\n",
    "        [Here](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/html/graphmlhtmls/Cocaine174localeq.5000.graphml.html) is a 5000 point downsampled version I made initially (verified accuracy by finding max brightness values and comparing them to the node values on the chart).\n",
    "        [Here](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/html/graphmlhtmls/Cocaine174localeqbig.graphml.html) is the 40k node false color version I made.  I also checked the maximum brightness value and compared it to the brightness I got by scanning the list.  \n",
    "    - For cross referencing, made a heat map coded for each 5%; shown [here](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/html/graphmlhtmls/Cocaine174localeq.5000.graphmlheatmap.html) is the corresponding edge to color mapping for the downsampled Cocaine174.  [Here](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/html/graphmlhtmls/Cocaine174localeqbig.graphmlheatmap.html) is the corresponding edge to color mapping for the full scale Cocaine174 plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Albert:**\n",
    "- [x] Create [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lkzhu1/ubuntu/) for pipeline with Luke.\n",
    "- [x] Set up [package page](https://github.com/alee156/clviz) for prototype with installation instructions.  Build passes on [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/alee156/clviz).\n",
